## Summary
Data grids are hard. A data grid is much more complicated than other components: sorting, filtering, paginating, searching and performance/weight are a few concerns. Reusable data grids must play nice with local and remote data, and must be very customizable for each unique implementation without bringing in the kitchen sink. In the Angular world, there already exist many solutions, both free and paid: UI Grid (in beta), Angular Grid, and Smart Table are a few of many. Most of the data grids currently available are poor solutions to a common need to throw tabular on the screen with Angular. In this talk, I will provide an overview into existing solutions, show pros and cons of each in live code, and show what you should consider when choosing a data grid -- either one available today or that you may encounter in the future.

## About me
I'm a frontend developer with Angular experience, and I've both built and consumed Angular data grids for a UI library built on Angular in my day job that many other teams consume with many different requirements. After the third iteration, we finally got it right. 

## Notes
Note: Participants are expected to have a good understanding of Angular.
